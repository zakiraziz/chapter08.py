Introduction
Functions in Python allow for modularity and reusability in code. This repository covers different types of functions and how they can be used with arguments, default values, and recursion.

Files and Topics Covered
1. functions.py
This file demonstrates the basics of function creation, including defining a function with the def keyword and calling it.

2. quick_quiz.py
This file contains exercises that reinforce the fundamental concepts of defining and using functions in Python.

3. function_with_arguments.py
This file covers different types of arguments:

Positional arguments: Passed based on their position in the function call.
Keyword arguments: Arguments passed using the parameter names.
4. default_with_argument.py
This file focuses on default arguments, showing how to set default values for function parameters, which are used when the caller doesn't provide values for those parameters.

5. recursion.py
This file introduces the concept of recursion, where a function calls itself. A common example of recursion, such as calculating the factorial of a number, is provided.

Conclusion
This repository serves as a guide for learning Python functions, covering essential topics like basic function definitions, passing arguments, default arguments, and recursion. Each file contains code examples to solidify your understanding of these core concepts.
